# Taxonomy Bootstrap Prompt

A project's taxonomy (its controlled categories and allowed values) is what
makes topic matching precise instead of noisy. The LabKAG backend never
proposes one itself — that is a judgment call about the domain, made here by
you (the agent), not a mechanical build step. The backend only stores and
validates whatever taxonomy you submit.

Use this when `taxonomy-get --project-id <id>` returns nothing for a project
that already has extracted papers, and someone wants topic matching to work
for it.

## Process

1. List the project's papers: `papers-list --project-id <id>`.
2. Ask the user (or infer from how they described the project) what a
   *typical* topic query against this project should return: a **handful**
   of tightly-specific papers, a **moderate**, review-slice-sized set, or
   **broad** recall across a whole sub-field. This shapes how granular the
   taxonomy needs to be — it is a one-time input to bootstrap, not something
   re-asked per topic (that happens separately in
   `topic_decomposition_prompt.md`, per query):
   - **Handful** → lean toward more categories (top of the 3-6 range) with
     narrower, more specific `allowed_values`, so two matched categories
     narrow the corpus sharply.
     - **Moderate** → the default: 3-6 categories sized to what's actually in
     the corpus (see step 4), values specific enough to be useful but broad
     enough to recur.
   - **Broad** → lean toward fewer categories (bottom of the 3-6 range) with
     coarser `allowed_values` (merge near-duplicate observed values into one
     canonical value + aliases more aggressively), so a paper only needs to
     agree on a couple of broad axes to corroborate.
   If the user gives no signal, default to "moderate."
3. Read a first sample of about 10 papers via
   `knowledge --paper-id <id> --project-id <id>`, spread across whatever
   sub-clusters are visible from the `papers-list` titles/years so the first
   read isn't accidentally narrow. Look at the free-text `methods`,
   `materials`, `conditions`, `metrics`, `results`, and `conclusions` fields
   already extracted for each paper.
4. **Before finalizing any categories, check in with the user once.** From
   this first ~10-paper read, you will already have (a) a rough sense of
   candidate classification axes (e.g. "I could organize this by
   catalyst/reagent, by reaction type, by substrate, or by application — which
   matters most for how you'll search this project?") and (b) any
   abbreviations or domain terms that came up ambiguous even after reading
   the sample (same bar as `topic_decomposition_prompt.md`'s disambiguation
   rule — only surface a term here if the sample genuinely didn't settle it,
   not every technical term). Ask both together as one question if there's
   anything to ask: propose your candidate axes and let the user redirect or
   confirm them, and list any unresolved terms for them to clarify. If the
   sample already makes the axes obvious and nothing came up ambiguous,
   state your proposed categories for confirmation rather than asking an
   open-ended question — a concrete proposal is easier to correct than a
   blank one. Skipping this check risks a taxonomy that fits your own
   framing of the papers but not the axis the user actually wants to search
   by, which only surfaces later as bad corroboration on real queries.
5. Read the rest of the representative sample (10-20 papers total is usually
   enough; more for a project spanning several sub-domains) with the
   confirmed direction in mind.
6. Infer categories that would actually distinguish these papers from each
   other for retrieval purposes — not generic bibliographic fields
   (title/journal/year already exist separately), but the domain-specific
   axes a researcher would search by, sized per step 2 above and directed by
   step 4. For a chemistry corpus this is typically something like
   catalyst/reagent class, substrate class, and reaction type; for a
   different domain the axes will be different. Do not copy a fixed category
   list from another project — derive it from what is actually in these
   papers.
7. For each category, enumerate the allowed values that actually appear
   across the sampled papers (plus close variants worth merging as aliases,
   e.g. "Fe(NO3)3", "iron nitrate", "ferric nitrate" as aliases of one
   canonical value "iron"). Do not invent values that were not observed.
8. Write the taxonomy to a local JSON file and submit it:

```text
py -3.10 labkag-reviewer-skill/scripts/labkag_api.py taxonomy-set \
  --project-id <id> --taxonomy taxonomy.json
```

If a taxonomy already exists for the project and this is an edit rather than
a first-time bootstrap, submitting a change that removes or renames an
existing value is a breaking change. `taxonomy-set` will report
`affected_papers_count` without applying the change unless you pass
`--confirm`. Always look at that count before confirming — a large number
means many already-tagged papers will need retagging, which is a real cost,
not a formality.

## Rules

- Keep the category count small (3-6). A taxonomy with too many categories
  makes topic decomposition ambiguous and dilutes the corroboration signal
  the matcher relies on (two matched categories should mean something).
- Prefer values that are specific enough to be useful but broad enough to
  recur across multiple papers — a value only one paper in the whole corpus
  would ever match is not a useful retrieval axis.
- Do not add a "document_scope" or similar generic category unless the
  project genuinely mixes document types (e.g. primary research vs. review
  vs. patent) in a way that matters for retrieval.
- `essential_by_default` on a category is a hint for topic decomposition
  (`topic_decomposition_prompt.md`), not a hard rule — the decomposer marks
  essential/supporting per-topic, not per-category. Set it for whichever
  reading is right most of the time for this category.

## Expected `taxonomy.json` shape

```json
{
  "project_id": "proj_123",
  "categories": [
    {
      "key": "catalyst_type",
      "description": "The primary catalyst or catalytic metal used.",
      "allowed_values": ["iron", "copper", "palladium", "gold"],
      "aliases": {
        "iron": ["Fe(NO3)3", "iron nitrate", "ferric nitrate", "Fe"]
      },
      "essential_by_default": true
    },
    {
      "key": "reaction_type",
      "description": "The core transformation the paper reports.",
      "allowed_values": ["aerobic_oxidation", "cross_coupling", "cyclization"],
      "aliases": {},
      "essential_by_default": true
    }
  ]
}
```
